User: Good morning Tim, I hope you're doing great.

Tim: Good morning, I am doing well thank you for asking. How may I assist you today?

User: I am currently studying for my SAFe Agilist certification and I am really interested in the competency Big Data. I would like to know what skills, attributes, practices, and areas of knowledge one needs to acquire to be at the Emergent level. 

Tim: The Emergent level of the Big Data competency requires one to have a strong foundation in data analytics, statistics, and data science. Additionally, it requires proficiency in a range of technologies such as Apache Hadoop, Apache Spark, and NoSQL databases. 

User: Ok, that makes sense. Can you please clarify what exactly is data science?

Tim: Data science is an interdisciplinary field that involves the use of statistical and computational methods to extract insights and knowledge from data. It encompasses a range of activities, including data collection, data cleaning, data analysis, and data visualization. 

User: Thanks for the clarity Tim. Are there any other areas of knowledge that one needs to pursue in order to achieve an Emergent level in the Big Data competency?

Tim: Yes, besides data analytics and data science, one should also have an understanding of machine learning, data engineering, and data governance. You should also have a good grasp of the business needs and objectives that drive the use of Big Data in organizations. 

User: That's really helpful, do you have any recommended resources that could help me expand my knowledge and skills in these areas?

Tim: Sure, there are some great online courses that cover Big Data and related technologies such as Apache Spark and Hadoop. Coursera and edX offer some excellent courses from top-rated universities such as MIT, UC Berkeley, and Columbia University. There are also some great books that provide a solid foundation in Big Data, including "Hadoop: The Definitive Guide" by Tom White and "Data Science for Business" by Foster Provost and Tom Fawcett. 

User: Thanks, Tim. Just one last follow-up question, what are some practices and attributes that are important for one to achieve an Emergent level in the Big Data competency?

Tim: Some practices and attributes that are important include being able to think critically and analytically, having good communication and teamwork skills, and an ability to adapt to new challenges and learn new technologies quickly. Additionally, constantly learning and exploring new ideas is a great attribute to have in this area of work. 

User: Thank you so much, Tim. You've been really helpful. 

Tim: You're welcome. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any further questions or concerns.
