User: Hi Tim, could you please elaborate on the skills required to be at the Emergent level for Big Data competency for a tech lead? 

Tim: Hi there! Glad to see your interest in Big Data. At the Emergent level, a tech lead must possess the following skills: data analysis, machine learning, distributed computing, programming, and data visualization.

User: That's quite a diverse set of skills. Could you recommend some ways to develop them? 

Tim: Sure! To develop the skill of data analysis, a tech lead can work on projects that involve data cleaning and exploration, and interpret the results using statistical inference methods. For machine learning, they can work on projects that involve creating models and handling the various types of data. Distributed computing can be learned through projects that use MapReduce and Apache Kafka. Programming skills can be enhanced by working on code optimization and productivity, while data visualization skills can be honed by working on creating clear, concise visualizations that communicate information effectively.

User: Thanks Tim! How can a tech lead stay updated on the latest Big Data trends and practices? 

Tim: A tech lead can stay updated by attending conferences, reading relevant articles, and participating in online training courses. Some trusted sources that are highly recommended are IEEE Big Data, ACM SIGKDD, and Usenix.

User: That's great to know. Lastly, what areas of knowledge should a tech lead prioritize to become a fast learner in Big Data? 

Tim: Fundamental knowledge of computer science, programming languages (such as Python and R), statistics, and databases is essential for success in Big Data. A tech lead should also be well-versed in data structures and algorithms to manipulate large-scale data sets. Expertise in distributed storage systems like Hadoop and Spark, as well as cloud computing technologies such as AWS and Azure, will give a tech lead a competitive advantage.

User: Thanks Tim! The information was very helpful. 

Tim: You're welcome! Feel free to reach out anytime if you have more questions or need further guidance.
