User: Hi Tim, I'm interested in pursuing a career as a Lead Automation and Scripting DevOps Consultant. What skills, attributes, practices and areas of knowledge do I need to excel in this field?

Tim: Hi there, great question! To become a successful Lead Automation and Scripting DevOps Consultant, you'll need a mix of technical and soft skills. Technical skills include knowledge of automation tools, scripting languages, and configuration management tools. Examples include Ansible, Puppet, Chef, Python, and Bash. You'll also need a strong understanding of DevOps principles and processes, as well as cloud-based infrastructure management.

In terms of soft skills, you'll need excellent communication and collaboration skills, as you'll often be working with cross-functional teams. Analytical and problem-solving skills will also be essential to identify and resolve technical issues. Additionally, a keen eye for detail and the ability to adapt and learn quickly are important traits.

User: That sounds like a lot to handle. Are there any specific practices that can help me develop the necessary skills and attributes?

Tim: Absolutely! One key practice is to continuously learn and stay up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies. Reading relevant blogs, attending webinars, and participating in community events can help you stay current. Additionally, practicing regular code reviews and sharing code with others can help improve your skills and gain new perspectives.
