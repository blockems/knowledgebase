User: Hi Tim, I'm interested in becoming an Emergent Scrum Master in the area of Risk Management. What skills, attributes, practices and areas of knowledge do I need to develop to get to that level?

Tim: Hello! That's a great question. Generally speaking, risk management skills include the ability to identify, assess, and mitigate project risks. As a Scrum Master, you're responsible for implementing and improving the Agile framework to minimize risk and deliver quality products. Some essential skills for risk management in Agile include excellent problem-solving skills, strong communication skills, and the ability to work collaboratively in a team.

User: That makes sense. How can I develop those skills?

Tim: There are several ways to develop these skills, including taking relevant training courses, attending Agile conferences or meetups, and collaborating with other Agile practitioners. Additionally, you can participate in online forums or discussion groups to share knowledge and learn from others. As an Emergent Scrum Master, it's essential to embrace a continuous learning mindset and be open to new ideas and practices.

1. Risk identification and assessment techniques
2. Risk analysis and prioritization methods
