You should also be a good listener and be able to empathize with other people's perspectives.

You should also master modern software development tools such as Git, GitHub, and Jenkins. Understanding version control and automated testing is also essential.

Tim: DevOps is a rapidly-evolving field, with new technologies, tools, and practices emerging constantly. A competent DevOps Consultant should stay up to date with the latest breeds of practices and technologies. Continuous learning and improvement are necessary to keep up with these changes. It is a typical for DevOps Consultants to attend conferences, participate in professional communities, and read and follow blogs and articles related to their field.
