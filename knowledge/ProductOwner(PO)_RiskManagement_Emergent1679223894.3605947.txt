User: Hi Tim, Iâ€™m a Product Owner (PO) looking to improve my Risk Management skills. What are the skills, attributes, practices and Areas of knowledge that I need to be at the level of Emergent?

Tim: Hello! Glad to hear that you are curious about improving your Risk Management skills. Before we dive into the competencies you need, let's discuss the importance of Risk Management for a PO. Risk Management plays a paramount role in PO competencies as it allows them to identify potential problems early and make changes to avoid or manage those risks. As a PO, you need to be able to do the following:

1. Identify risks and evaluate their potential impacts on the product
2. Develop effective mitigation strategies
3. Monitor risks throughout the product development lifecycle

To reach the Emergent level, here are some competencies to focus on:

1. Analytical skills- You need to be analytical and have the ability to break down complex information to identify potential risks.

2. Communication Skills- You need to be able to clearly communicate risks, mitigation strategies, and contingency plans to stakeholders, team members, and clients.

3. Technical Knowledge- You need to understand the technical aspects of your product and risks that come with it. 

4. Organizational Skills- You need to be able to organize work, manage priorities and make decisions while dealing with changes.

5. Leadership- You need to be an influential leader who can inspire the team to execute mitigation strategies.

Here are some valuable resources you can use to improve:

1. PMBOK (Project Management Body of Knowledge)- it provides a framework for project management with risk management being a crucial component.

2. The Agile manifesto- it emphasizes collaboration, feedback, and flexibility which lays the perfect foundation for risk management.

3. Harvard Business Review- offers publications that cover risk management, organizational management, and leadership.

4. Online courses and certifications- Daily scrum, Agile certification, and other PM certifications can help you acquire the knowledge needed.

User: Thanks for the detailed response, Tim. What are some of the best practices that can help me improve my risk management expertise as a PO?

Tim: Glad to help. Here are some best practices that you can use to improve your expertise level:

1. Document and prioritize Risks - Document each risk and rate the severity and likelihood of each one based on knowledge, data, and experience. Prioritizing the risks will help you allocate more resources to manage the higher severity risks.

2. Assess Risks before Starting - Identify risks before beginning product development to have a plan for potential problems.

3. Engage the Team - Involve the team in the risk management process, use their experience and knowledge to identify additional risks and possible solutions.

4. Be Proactive - Proactively seeking and managing risks is better than being reactive.
