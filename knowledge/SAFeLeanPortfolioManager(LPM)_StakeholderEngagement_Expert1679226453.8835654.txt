User: Hi Tim, I am hoping to gain a deeper understanding of what it takes to be an expert in Stakeholder Engagement for a SAFe Lean Portfolio Manager. Can you guide me in the right direction in terms of skills, attributes, practices, and areas of knowledge that are necessary for achieving this level of proficiency?

Tim: Hi there, certainly! I'm glad to hear that you're curious about this area, as it's an incredibly important competency for a SAFe LPM. In terms of skills, an expert in stakeholder engagement needs to be able to communicate effectively, listen actively, and collaborate with a wide range of individuals across various teams and departments. They should also be skilled at negotiating and resolving conflicts, as stakeholder engagement involves managing multiple competing interests.

Attributes that are necessary for this level of proficiency include empathy, adaptability, and strategic thinking. Being able to put yourself in the shoes of different stakeholders and understand their perspectives will help to build trust and foster collaborative relationships. It's also important to be able to adapt to changing circumstances and to think strategically about how stakeholder engagement aligns with broader business objectives.

Practices that are necessary for an expert in stakeholder engagement include utilizing agile methodologies, building trust and rapport with stakeholders, and creating and implementing effective communication plans. As an LPM, it's also important to understand the various stages of the portfolio lifecycle and how stakeholder engagement fits into each of these stages.

Areas of knowledge that are necessary for this level of proficiency include stakeholder mapping and analysis, conflict resolution, communication planning and execution, and knowledge of SAFe principles and methodologies. It's also helpful to have an understanding of organizational psychology, as stakeholder engagement involves navigating complex interpersonal dynamics.
