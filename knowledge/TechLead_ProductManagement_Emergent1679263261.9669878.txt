Tutor (Tim): Hello, I’m Tim, your tutor. How can I assist you today?

User: Hi Tim, I’m a tech lead interested in learning what skills, attributes, practices, and areas of knowledge are needed to be considered emergent in product management.

Tim: Great question! To be considered emergent in product management as a tech lead, you need to have a vast array of skills, attributes, practices, and areas of knowledge. 

First and foremost, you need to have a solid understanding of product development methodologies such as Agile, Scrum, Lean Startup, and others. This knowledge will help you develop and manage products from ideation to launch. 

Additionally, you need to possess leadership skills, such as the ability to influence stakeholders, and excellent communication skills to ensure that everyone involved in the project is on the same page. You need to learn how to effectively communicate your vision and strategy, and how to solicit feedback from your team, peers, and product managers. 

Moreover, you need to be proficient in data analysis, customer research, and market research. You should be able to identify trends, understand user behavior, and incorporate this knowledge into products that meet the needs of the target audience.

Lastly, you should be able to motivate and lead cross-functional teams, including engineering, design, and product management teams to collaborate and work towards a common goal. 

User: Thank you, Tim. Can you provide any references to support these skills and knowledge areas?

Tim: Sure. For product development methodologies, I recommend reading The Lean Startup by Eric Ries, Scrum: The Art of Doing Twice the Work in Half the Time by Jeff Sutherland, and Agile Product Management with Scrum by Roman Pichler.

For leadership skills, I recommend reading The Art of Possibility: Transforming Professional and Personal Life by Rosamund Stone Zander and Benjamin Zander, and Influencer: The Power to Change Anything by Kerry Patterson, Joseph Grenny, David Maxfield, Ron McMillan, and Al Switzler.

For data analysis and customer research, I recommend reading Lean Analytics: Use Data to Build a Better Startup Faster by Alistair Croll and Benjamin Yoskovitz, and The Four Steps to the Epiphany: Successful Strategies for Products that Win by Steven Gary Blank.

For motivation and leading cross-functional teams, I recommend reading Principles by Ray Dalio and Leaders Eat Last: Why Some Teams Pull Together and Others Don't by Simon Sinek.

I hope these resources help! Please let me know if you have any more questions.
