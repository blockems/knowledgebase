User: Hi Tim, I'm interested in learning more about becoming an expert Enterprise Architect. Can you share some insights on the required skills, attributes, practices and areas of knowledge?

Tim: Hi there. Becoming an expert Enterprise Architect requires a range of skills, attributes, practices and areas of knowledge. Firstly, you need a solid foundation in systems thinking and modeling, which includes understanding the interdependencies between systems and their components. Could you tell me more about your background in this area?

User: I have a degree in computer science and a few years of experience in software development. I've also been working on some design projects recently.

Tim: That's a great start. To become an expert Enterprise Architect, you'll need to supplement your background with a deep understanding of enterprise architecture frameworks and methodologies such as TOGAF, Zachman, and FEAF.

User: What particular areas of these frameworks should I focus on?

Tim: You should focus on understanding the key components of these frameworks, such as their architecture domains, layers, viewpoints and stakeholders. Also, pay attention to how they help you organize and manage complex systems and their interdependencies.

User: Interesting. What attributes do I need to become an expert Enterprise Architect?

Tim: Great question. To become an expert Enterprise Architect, you should possess strong analytical, communication, and problem-solving skills. You should also have excellent leadership and team management skills, as architecture development often involves collaboration between multiple stakeholders. Additionally, you should have the ability to work under pressure and be able to adapt to changing circumstances.

User: Thanks for sharing. What practices should I adopt to become an expert Enterprise Architect?

Tim: There are several practices that can help you become an expert Enterprise Architect. Firstly, you should adopt a Agile mindset and approach, which will help you to be more flexible and adaptive to change. You should also focus on continuous learning and development, attending conferences, seminars or webinars, and participate in professional communities. Lastly, you should make use of modelling tools, and practice designing complex systems using these tools.

User: Great advice, Tim. Are there any other areas of knowledge that I should focus on?

Tim: Yes, as an Enterprise Architect, you should also have a deep understanding of emerging technologies such as cloud, machine learning, and edge computing. This understanding will help you to stay ahead of the curve and be able to design systems that leverage these technologies.

User: That makes sense. Thanks for your insights, Tim. Can you recommend any specific references I can use to further enhance my knowledge in these areas?

Tim: Absolutely. Here are some references that I would recommend:

1. "Enterprise Architecture Planning: Developing a Blueprint for Data, Applications, and Technology" by Steven H. Spewak 
2. "TOGAF, The Open Group Architecture Framework 9" by Andrew Josey 
3. "The Zachman Framework for Enterprise Architecture: A Primer on Enterprise Architecture" by John A. Zachman 

These should give you a good grounding in Enterprise Architecture and its related tools and concepts.
