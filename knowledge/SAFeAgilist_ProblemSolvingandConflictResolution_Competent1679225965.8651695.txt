User: Hi Tim, I'm struggling with understanding the skills, attributes and practices needed to be competent in Problem Solving and Conflict Resolution for a SAFe Agilist. Can you help me out?

Tim: Hi there! I'd be happy to help. In terms of skills, a SAFe Agilist would need to have strong analytical and critical thinking skills, as well as the ability to identify problems and generate creative solutions. They would also require excellent communication and interpersonal skills, to be able to manage conflict effectively. Additionally, an understanding of root cause analysis and systems thinking is crucial.

User: That makes sense. What attributes would you say are important?

Tim: Great question! A SAFe Agilist must have the ability to remain calm under pressure, be adaptable and flexible, and be willing to continuously learn and improve. They should also have political acumen, to navigate complex organizational structures and handle conflicting opinions diplomatically.

User: I see. And what about practices? What should a SAFe Agilist do to be competent in Problem Solving and Conflict Resolution?

Tim: A few key practices would be to employ a structured approach to problem solving, such as the Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle, or Lean Startup principles. Additionally, it's important to establish clear communication channels and encourage open dialogue in order to prevent misunderstandings and conflicts. Conflict resolution frameworks, such as the Thomas-Kilmann Instrument, can also be helpful.

User: Thanks, Tim. Do you have any references that I could use to learn more about this topic?

Tim: Sure thing! For skills, I would recommend the book "Think Smarter: Critical Thinking to Improve Problem-Solving and Decision-Making Skills" by Michael Kallet. For attributes, "The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People" by Stephen Covey is a classic. And for practices, you can refer to "The Five Dysfunctions of a Team" by Patrick Lencioni or "Difficult Conversations: How to Discuss What Matters Most" by Douglas Stone, Bruce Patton, and Sheila Heen.

User: Thank you so much, Tim! Your thorough explanations and recommendations have been very helpful. I really appreciate it.

Tim: My pleasure. Keep up the curiosity and best of luck in your studies!
