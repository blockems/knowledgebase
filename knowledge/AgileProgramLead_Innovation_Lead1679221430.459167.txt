User: Hi Tim, I am interested in becoming a lead for the competency Innovation as an Agile Program Lead. Can you tell me more about the skills, attributes, practices, and areas of knowledge I need to have to be successful in this role?

Tim: Hi there! That's a great question. Before we dive in, let me ask you something. How would you define innovation in an Agile program setting?

User: I would say innovation in an Agile program setting involves constantly seeking out new ideas and approaches to improve processes and products, while remaining flexible and adaptable to changing conditions.

Tim: Excellent definition! You are absolutely right. As a lead for the competency Innovation, you will need to embody those qualities and encourage your team to do the same. In terms of skills, you will need to have a strong foundation in Agile principles and practices, as well as experience with techniques such as design thinking and lean startup. You will also need to possess strong leadership and communication skills, as you will be responsible for guiding and inspiring your team.

User: Thank you for the overview. Could you tell me more about the specific practices and techniques I should be familiar with?

Tim: Certainly. Some of the key Agile practices and techniques you should be familiar with include Scrum, Kanban, and XP. You should also have experience with practices such as continuous integration and deployment, as well as automated testing. In terms of design thinking, you should be familiar with techniques such as empathy mapping, ideation, prototyping, and user testing. For lean startup, you should be familiar with the build-measure-learn cycle and minimum viable products.

User: This is all very helpful. What about the areas of knowledge I should be proficient in?

Tim: Good question. Along with Agile practices and techniques, you should have a solid understanding of software development principles, including software architecture and design patterns, as well as web development frameworks and languages such as Java, Python, and Ruby on Rails. You should also have knowledge of business strategy and market analysis, in order to help your team identify new opportunities for innovation.

User: Thank you for the detailed response, Tim. Can you provide any references or resources where I can learn more about these skills, practices, and areas of knowledge?

Tim: Absolutely. For Agile practices and techniques, I would recommend reading the Agile Manifesto and the Scrum Guide. For design thinking, check out IDEO's Design Thinking page, as well as the book "Designing for Growth" by Jeanne Liedtka and Tim Ogilvie. For lean startup, read "The Lean Startup" by Eric Ries. For software development principles and web development frameworks, I would recommend "Clean Code" by Robert C. Martin and "Agile Web Development with Rails" by Sam Ruby, Dave Thomas, and David Heinemeier Hansson. For business strategy, "The Innovator's Dilemma" by Clayton Christensen is a classic resource.

User: Thank you so much, Tim! I appreciate all the guidance and resources. I'm excited to dive deeper into these topics and develop my skills as a Lead for the competency Innovation.

Tim: You're welcome, and good luck on your journey! Remember to always stay curious and open-minded. That's the key to being a successful Agile Program Lead.
