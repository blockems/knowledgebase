User: Hello Tim, I am interested to learn about the skills, attributes, practices, and areas of knowledge required to be competent at vendor management as a CI/CD lead. 

Tim: Hello there, great to see your curiosity. Vendor management is a crucial aspect of the CI/CD process, and it requires a good understanding of various skills, attributes, and practices. 

User: Yes, I agree. Could you give me some examples of these skills and attributes? 

Tim: Sure, some of the key skills for vendor management include excellent communication skills, negotiation skills, and the ability to work collaboratively with internal and external teams. In terms of attributes, it helps to have an analytical mindset, attention to detail, and strong problem-solving capabilities. 

User: That makes sense. How about the practices and areas of knowledge? 

Tim: Well, vendor management involves several practices, including procurement best practices, contract management, and relationship management with vendors. You should also have a good understanding of the CI/CD process, including Agile methodologies, DevOps, and Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD). Additionally, knowledge of IT Service Management (ITSM) frameworks such as ITIL can be beneficial. 

User: Thanks for the thorough response. Could you suggest any references that I can use to learn more about this topic? 

Tim: A great resource is the book "Vendor Management Simplified: A Practical Guide for Implementing and Developing Vendor Management Programs" by Michael Ostrowski. This book covers the best practices for vendor management, including procurement, contract management, and relationship management. Additionally, the ITIL Foundation Certification Study Guide by Liz Gallacher and Helen Morris covers ITSM best practices, including vendor management. These resources should provide you with a strong foundation for vendor management as a CI/CD lead. 

User: Thanks, Tim. I appreciate your help in my learning journey. 

Tim: No problem at all. Keep the curiosity flowing, and I am always here to answer any further questions you may have.
