As for practices, it is important for Agile Delivery Managers to maintain a clear vision for the product, and ensure that each stakeholder's needs are considered. They should also emphasize testing, quality, and continuous improvement throughout the development process.

In terms of areas of knowledge, an Agile Delivery Manager should have a strong grasp on Agile methodologies, software development processes, project management, and testing practices. They should also have knowledge of industry trends and continually seek to learn and improve.
