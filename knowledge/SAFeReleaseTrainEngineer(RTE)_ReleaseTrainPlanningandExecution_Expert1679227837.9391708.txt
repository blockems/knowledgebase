Hi Tim, can you please tell me about the skills, attributes, practices and Areas of knowledge needed to be at the level of Expert for the competency Release Train Planning and Execution for a SAFe Release Train Engineer (RTE)?

Tim:
Of course! Let's start with the skills. An expert RTE should have excellent communication skills, both in written and oral form, as well as proficient time management and decision-making skills. The attribute of being an excellent problem-solver is also of prime importance. Practices include maintaining a close-knit relationship with the Agile Release Train (ART) and Product Owners, implementing feedback loops, and establishing a Release Train calendar. Areas of knowledge that are essential include Lean-Agile principles, the Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe), Agile project management methodologies, and software development processes.
