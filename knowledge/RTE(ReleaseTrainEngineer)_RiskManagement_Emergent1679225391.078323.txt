User: Hi Tim, I'm interested in becoming an Emergent level Release Train Engineer. What skills, attributes, practices, and areas of knowledge do I need to have?

Tim: Great question! To be an Emergent level RTE, you need to have a combination of technical, interpersonal, and leadership skills. On the technical side, you should have a solid understanding of Agile and Lean methodologies, Release Train engineering processes, and Risk Management.

User: That makes sense. Can you elaborate on what it means to be proficient in Risk Management as an RTE?

Tim: Sure. As an RTE, you need to be able to manage risks and issues at the program level. This involves identifying potential risks early on, assessing their potential impact, and creating plans to mitigate them. You should also be able to track the status of risks, report on them regularly to stakeholders, and make adjustments to your mitigation plans as needed.

User: That sounds complex. What are some steps that RTEs can take to effectively manage risk at the program level?

Tim: There are a few things you can do. First, make sure you have a Risk Management plan that outlines the process for identifying, analyzing, and mitigating risks. This plan should be reviewed and updated regularly. Second, establish a culture of risk management within the program by training teams on how to identify and report risks, and by creating channels for open communication. Third, make sure you have a tool or platform for tracking risks and issues at the program level.

User: That makes sense. What about attributes and practices that are important for an RTE?

Tim: As an RTE, it's crucial that you have strong leadership skills, including the ability to motivate and inspire others, provide direction and guidance, and facilitate collaboration. You should also have excellent communication and interpersonal skills, be able to build and maintain relationships with stakeholders, and be comfortable working under pressure and in high-stress situations.

User: Thanks, Tim, that's really helpful. Can you provide any supporting references that I can read up on to learn more?

Tim: Certainly. Here are a few resources that I recommend:
