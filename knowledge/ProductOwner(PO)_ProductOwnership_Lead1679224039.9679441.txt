User: Hi Tim, I've been reading up on the competencies of a Product Owner (PO), and I'm wondering what skills, attributes, practices and Areas of knowledge are needed to be at the level of Lead for the competency Product Ownership?

Tim: Great question! Becoming a Lead for the competency Product Ownership requires not only a deep understanding of the product vision and customer needs but also the ability to lead and inspire a team. 

Some key skills would include stakeholder management, team facilitation, and prioritization. It's also important to have a strong business acumen, which includes financial analysis and forecasting, market analysis, and understanding of key industry trends. 

In terms of attributes, a Lead PO should possess excellent communication skills, critical thinking abilities, and be adaptable to change. They should also have a passion for innovation and be continuously seeking new ways to improve and advance the product. 

Finally, there are several practices that a Lead PO should be familiar with including Agile methodology, user story mapping, and product roadmapping. 

If you want to dive deeper into this topic, I highly recommend reading the book "Inspired: How to Create Products Customers Love" by Marty Cagan. It's considered a must-read for aspiring Product Owners and Leaders in the field. 

User: Thank you for the detailed response Tim, can you give an example of how stakeholder management is important for a Lead PO?

Tim: Of course! Stakeholder management is essential for a Lead PO because they need to understand the needs and expectations of all stakeholders involved in the project. This includes customers, internal teams, executives, and external partners. By managing and communicating with stakeholders effectively, a Lead PO can ensure that the product is meeting everyone's needs and expectations, which can lead to increased buy-in and support. 

Additionally, stakeholder management plays a key role in prioritization and decision making. By understanding the priorities and preferences of different stakeholders, a Lead PO can make informed decisions about what features or changes to prioritize. 

If you're interested in learning more about stakeholder management, I recommend checking out the book "Managing Stakeholder Expectations for Project Success" by Jack Gido and James Clements. It provides a comprehensive guide to stakeholder management and its importance in project management.
