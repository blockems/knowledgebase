Tutor (Tim): Hello there. I'm happy to help with any questions you have about becoming an Emergent Product Owner in Market Analysis. What can I help you with today?

User: Thank you for offering to help. Can you start by explaining what skills, attributes and practices are needed for an Emergent PO in Market Analysis?

Tutor (Tim): Certainly, the Emergent level for a Product Owner in Market Analysis requires a range of skills, attributes, and practices. 

Skills include deep knowledge of market research techniques, consumer behavior, data analysis, and business intelligence tools. Additionally, presentation and data visualization skills are key, as it is important to distill research insights into actionable recommendations for the business.

Attributes that are important include strong critical thinking ability, strategic thinking, and the ability to collaborate and communicate effectively with cross-functional teams. Finally, a growth mindset is key, as the best POs are constantly looking for ways to evolve their skillsets and approaches.

In terms of practices, POs must be skilled at conducting market research, analyzing data, and synthesizing findings into insights and recommendations. Additionally, they must be able to effectively communicate those findings to stakeholders and develop plans to act on those insights.

User: Thank you, that's quite helpful. Can you suggest any reference books, articles, or other materials that would be useful to read if I wanted to expand my knowledge around these areas?

Tutor (Tim): Absolutely, here are some resources I recommend:

- "The Lean Product Playbook" by Dan Olsen is a great resource on product development and market analysis practices.
- "Market Research in Practice" by Paul Hague is a comprehensive guide to conducting market research and analyzing data.
- "Good Charts" by Scott Berinato provides practical guidance on data visualization techniques.

In terms of articles, "The Ultimate Guide to Product Owner Skills" by Roman Pichler and "The Product Owner's Role in Agile Development" by Mike Cohn are both excellent resources. 

Finally, I highly recommend seeking out industry events and networking opportunities to learn from professionals in the field and stay up-to-date on the latest trends and best practices. 

Hope this helps! Do you have any other questions?
