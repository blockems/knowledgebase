User: Hello Tim, can you tell me what skills and attributes are required to be at the Emergent level for the competency Agile Scaling Frameworks for an Agile Program Lead?

Tim: Hi, great question. Being at the Emergent level for Agile Scaling Frameworks requires a strong mix of technical and soft skills. Technical skills include a deep understanding of Agile methodologies and frameworks, scaling techniques such as SAFe, LeSS, or Nexus, and the ability to drive change within an organization. Soft skills include leadership, communication, collaboration, and the ability to mentor and coach others.

User: That is quite a mix of skills. Can you elaborate on the soft skills needed for this level?

Tim: Absolutely, soft skills are critical for success at the Emergent level. Leadership in terms of leading by example and embodying Agile principles is key. Communication skills include the ability to communicate complex ideas effectively and to facilitate conversations between team members. Collaboration skills entail working closely with stakeholders, teams, and individuals to achieve set objectives. Mentoring and coaching are important to help team members continuously improve their skills and abilities. 

User: That makes sense. What practices should one adopt to become an Emergent Agile scaling practitioner?

Tim: Adopting Agile practices and ceremonies is a great way to start. You should have experience with Agile methodologies like Scrum or Kanban and understand the ceremonies like sprint planning, daily stand-ups, and retrospectives. Additionally, you should have experience with scaling techniques like SAFe, LeSS, or Nexus. 

User: Thank you Tim. Can you recommend any books, courses or resources that one could use to augment their scaling skills?

Tim: Of course, there are several resources available. I would recommend "Agile Estimating and Planning" by Mike Cohn for a better understanding of Agile planning and estimating. "Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) Distilled" by Richard Knaster and Dean Leffingwell is a great resource for learning about the SAFe framework. Additionally, there are several online courses available on Udemy, Pluralsight and LinkedIn Learning which can provide a structured learning experience. 

User: Thank you for your time Tim. This has been very informative.

Tim: You're welcome. Always happy to help cultivate curiosity and promote learning.
