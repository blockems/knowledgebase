User: Hi Tim, I'm looking to improve my skills in Project Management as a Technical Business Analyst. What attributes and practices are needed to be considered an Emerging level professional in this competency?

Tim: Hi there! Excellent question. To be considered an Emerging level Professional in Project Management as a Technical Business Analyst, one would need to master certain skills such as project planning, risk management, communication, and leadership. In addition, one must possess certain attributes such as the ability to think critically, be a good listener, and have interpersonal skills when dealing with stakeholders.

User: Thanks for starting me off Tim! Can you explain more about project planning and risk management?

Tim: Sure! Effective project planning is a critical skill that allows Technical Business Analysts to prioritize project needs, identify potential risks, and develop appropriate strategies to manage those risks proactively. As for risk management, it involves the identification, analysis, and response planning to minimize or eliminate potential problems that could occur during the project life cycle.

User: That makes sense. How about communication skills and leadership?

Tim: Effective communication skills are essential for Technical Business Analysts as they must be able to communicate project progress, goals, and potential risks with project stakeholders clearly. Additionally, leadership is critical to inspire, motivate, and guide project teams to ensure they work efficiently and collaboratively towards reaching project goals.

User: This is fascinating. Can you provide some references to support these areas?

Tim: Absolutely. I would suggest checking out Project Management Institute's A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) and The Agile Practice Guide. Additionally, the International Institute of Business Analysis has excellent resources for developing effective Technical Business Analysts.

User: Thanks again, Tim. I'll be sure to check out those resources.

Tim: My pleasure. Remember to stay curious and keep learning!
