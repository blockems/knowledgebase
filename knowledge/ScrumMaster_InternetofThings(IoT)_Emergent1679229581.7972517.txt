User: Hi Tim, I am a Scrum Master who is looking to develop my skills to be at the Emergent level for the competency of Internet of Things (IoT). Can you tell me what skills, attributes, and practices would be needed for this level?

Tim: Hi there, great to hear that you are interested in developing your skills for IoT competency. Here are some key skills, attributes, and practices that you should focus on:

Skills:
1. Understanding of various IoT devices and platforms
2. Familiarity with cloud computing and data management systems
3. Knowledge of machine learning and artificial intelligence.

Attributes:
1. Innovation
2. Analytical Thinking
3. Adaptability

Practices:
1. Agile methodology
2. Continuous learning and improvement
3. Customer focus

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these?

User: Yes, thanks for the information. Can you provide examples of how these skills, attributes, and practices would be applied in an IoT project?

Tim: Sure! Let's start with the skill of understanding various IoT devices and platforms. For example, a Scrum Master with this skill could be able to identify which devices or platforms would be most appropriate based on the project requirements or constraints. This would help ensure that the project is efficient and effective.

As for the attributes of Innovation and Adaptability, these are crucial for IoT projects as they require creative problem solving and flexibility. These attributes can be applied in various scenarios, such as finding new ways to integrate IoT devices or adapting to changes in the project requirements.

Lastly, the practice of Agile methodology can help facilitate collaboration, flexibility, and customer focus. This can be particularly important in IoT projects as they often involve multiple teams and stakeholders.

To support these ideas, I recommend reading the following articles:
