User: Hi Tim! Thank you so much for agreeing to tutor me on Systems Thinking for Agile Delivery Managers. I have been struggling with this competency and I am excited to learn more about it.

Tim: Hello, glad to be of help. Before we start, it's important to understand that Systems Thinking is a broad topic that covers many areas of knowledge. It's important to approach it with an open mind and a willingness to explore complex systems. So, what specific questions do you have?

User: Well, I am interested in knowing what skills and attributes are needed to be at the level of Emergent in this competency. Can you shed some light on this?

Tim: Yes, of course. At the emergent level, the Agile Delivery Manager should have a deep understanding of Systems Thinking principles and practices. They should be able to analyze complex systems and identify patterns, relationships, and interactions, and leverage this understanding to improve their project delivery.

Some of the skills and attributes that are needed at this level include critical thinking, systems analysis, and synthesis, problem-solving, data analysis, communication skills, and leadership skills, to mention a few.

User: Wow, that sounds like a lot. Can you recommend any resources I can use to improve in these areas?

Tim: Absolutely! There are many resources you can use to improve your skills and knowledge in Systems Thinking. Some good starting points include the "Thinking in Systems" book by Donella Meadows, the "The Fifth Discipline" by Peter Senge, and the "Systems Thinking for Social Change" course by the Waters Foundation. Additionally, you can also practice your skills by analyzing complex systems in your workplace, participate in communities of practice, and attend conferences and workshops.

User: Thank you so much, Tim! This has been very helpful. I look forward to implementing these suggestions and building my competency in Systems Thinking.

Tim: You're welcome! Remember, curiosity is key to building your knowledge and skills in Systems Thinking. Always keep questioning the status quo, and exploring new ways of thinking about complex systems. Good luck!
