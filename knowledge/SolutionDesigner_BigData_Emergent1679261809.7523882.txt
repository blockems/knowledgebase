User: Hi Tim, I heard you’re an expert in Agile coaching and program management. I’m looking to improve my skills in Big Data and become an Emergent level Solution Designer. What skills, attributes, practices, and areas of knowledge do I need to reach the Emergent level?

Tim: Hi there! That's a great question. To become an Emergent level Solution Designer in Big Data, you'll need skills in statistics, data analytics, programming, and machine learning. You'll also need to have a deep understanding of Big Data technologies, such as Hadoop and Spark. Moreover, being proficient in Agile methodologies and frameworks like Scrum and Lean will be advantageous to you.

User: Thanks, Tim. Could you elaborate more on why Agile methodologies and frameworks are essential?

Tim: Of course! Agile methodologies aim to deliver software development projects quickly and efficiently, allowing organizations to adapt to changes in the business environment. Employing Agile practices will enable you to handle the vast amounts of data that Big Data projects typically generate, allowing you to analyze, interpret, and visualize the data much faster.

Moreover, Agile practices might help you to solve complex problems using incremental development instead of a traditional waterfall approach. Therefore, it would be beneficial to have Agile skills when working with Big Data, as it'll enable you to manage the project effectively and efficiently.

User: That makes sense; thanks for clarifying. What attributes do I need to become an Emergent level Solution Designer?

Tim: Being a Solution Designer in Big Data requires you to be an analytical thinker, have excellent communication skills, detail-oriented and be a critical thinker. You'll need to be able to solve complex problems and work collaboratively with the team. Additionally, you'll need to have a creative mindset to innovate new and exciting solutions using Big Data technologies.

User: Great, that sounds like me! What are the areas of knowledge I need to become an Emergent level Solution Designer?

Tim: You'll need extensive knowledge in machine learning algorithms, programming languages like Python or R, data analytics tools such as SQL and Data Visualizations techniques using tools like Tableau. You'll also need a clear understanding of Data Warehousing, Information Management, Data Governance, and Security.

Moreover, you'll need to be proficient in working with large datasets, handling unstructured data, and identifying patterns in data. Finally, you should be able to interpret and convey complex data insights to different stakeholders.

User: Wow, that's a lot of areas to cover. Do you have any resources/references that you recommend?

Tim: Absolutely, I suggest you check out the following:
