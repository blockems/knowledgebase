User: Hi Tim, I am interested in becoming a SAFe Lean Portfolio Manager (LPM). What are the key skills and attributes needed to be competent in this role?

Tim: Hi there, great to hear you are interested in becoming a SAFe LPM. In order to be competent in this role, one would need a combination of technical, interpersonal, and strategic skills. Some of the key technical skills include understanding the principles and practices of Lean, Agile, and SAFe frameworks, as well as financial analysis and portfolio management.

User: Thanks Tim, can you go into a bit more detail on the interpersonal and strategic skills needed?

Tim: Of course. The interpersonal skills that are important for an LPM include communication, collaboration, leadership, and facilitation. Effective communication is key in order to establish trust with stakeholders and align the organization around the portfolio strategy. Collaboration and leadership skills are needed to facilitate decision-making and problem-solving across multiple teams and departments. The strategic skills needed include creating and executing a portfolio vision, driving innovation, and risk management.

User: That makes sense. Are there any best practices or areas of knowledge that are particularly important for a SAFe LPM?

Tim: Yes, there are several. In terms of best practices, one would need to have a thorough understanding of SAFe portfolio management as well as experience in implementing portfolio management processes. Knowledge of portfolio prioritization techniques such as Weighted Shortest Job First (WSJF) is also important. For areas of knowledge, it would be beneficial to have knowledge of product development, systems thinking, and Lean-Agile budgeting and funding. An understanding of strategic planning, value stream mapping, and PI planning would also be beneficial.
