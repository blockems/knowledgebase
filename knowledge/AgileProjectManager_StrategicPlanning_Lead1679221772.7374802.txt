These resources go in-depth on Agile practices and give practical advice on strategic planning. 

User: That's helpful, thanks Tim. Finally, could you give me an example of how you have used your strategic planning skills as an Agile Project Manager?

Using my strategic planning skills, I collaborated with the team leads to reassess our priorities and develop a new plan with milestones that would enable us to complete the project within the remaining budget and timeline. This involved using Agile principles and techniques like Scrum, Lean, and Kanban to deliver value early and often.
