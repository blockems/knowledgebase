User: Hi Tim, I'm very curious about what it takes to be at the level of Emergent for the competency of Risk Management as a SAFe Product Owner (PO). Can you give some insights on the skills and attributes needed for this role?

Tim: Sure, Risk Management is a crucial competency for SAFe Product owners to master. To be at the level of Emergent, a PO should have a solid understanding of risk identification, analysis, prioritization and mitigation strategies. This requires strong analytical skills, critical thinking, decision making and communication skills. To be effective, a PO needs to collaborate with stakeholders to identify and prioritize risks that impact the product and business objectives. 

User: That makes sense, Tim. Can you offer some specific practices that can be used to identify and mitigate risks in SAFe Agile?

Tim: Yes, of course. There are many practical strategies and techniques that can be used for Risk Management in SAFe Agile. For instance, the PO can use impact mapping, SWOT analysis, and value stream mapping to identify potential risks. Additionally, POs should maintain a product risk backlog and establish strong communication channels with stakeholders for early identification and mitigation of risks. It is also critical to keep a continuous improvement mindset and adjust the risk management strategies based on lessons learned from past experiences.

User: Thanks Tim, it sounds like I need to acquire some foundational knowledge in Risk Management as a PO. Can you recommend any resources or materials that I can use for that?

Tim: Definitely. For a comprehensive understanding of Risk Management, I recommend reading the Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) documentation on Risk Management in the SAFe 5.0 Release Train Engineer (RTE) reference guide. This document offers practical insights into identifying risks, developing mitigation strategies and tracking progress. Additionally, for a more generic understanding of Risk Management principles, the PMBOK Guide by the Project Management Institute is a great resource to start with.

User: Thanks for the recommendations, Tim. I think I have a good idea of the skills, attributes, and practices needed for Risk Management as a SAFe Product Owner at the Emergent level. 

Tim: That's great to hear. Remember, always maintain a curious mindset and be open to learning new things. That's what separates the best POs from the rest.
