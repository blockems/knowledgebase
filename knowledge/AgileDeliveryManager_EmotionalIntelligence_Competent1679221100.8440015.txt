User: Hi Tim, I’m looking to improve my Emotional Intelligence as an Agile Delivery Manager. Can you help me out?

Tim: Hi there! Of course, I’d love to help. What do you feel are some of your strongest areas in Emotional Intelligence right now?

User: Well, I think I’m pretty good at recognizing and understanding emotions in myself and others. But I struggle with managing those emotions in high-stress situations.

Tim: Ah, I see. That’s definitely a common struggle. In order to become competent in Emotional Intelligence as an Agile Delivery Manager, you’ll need to develop some key skills and attributes along with some key knowledge areas. Would you like me to elaborate on those?

User: Yes please, I’d love to know more about what I need to focus on.

Tim: Great, let’s start with the skills and attributes. One key skill you’ll need to develop is self-awareness. This involves constant reflection on your emotions and how they’re impacting your behavior. You’ll also need to work on empathy, which is the ability to understand and relate to other people’s emotions. Additionally, you’ll need strong communication skills and conflict resolution skills to effectively manage emotions in a team.

In terms of attributes, Emotional Intelligence requires a strong degree of emotional maturity, adaptability, self-confidence, and resilience.

Moving onto knowledge areas, you’ll need to gain a deep understanding of emotional regulation, social awareness, and relationship management. These areas include knowledge of psychology, neuroscience, and communication theories.

User: That’s a lot to work on! Can you recommend any resources or books for further study?

Tim: Absolutely, here are some great resources to help you get started:

1. Emotional Intelligence 2.0 by Travis Bradberry
2. The Emotional Intelligence Appraisal by Talent Smart
3. Go Beyond Emotional Intelligence by Emanuel Tobey

These resources are widely regarded as excellent sources for gaining a broader understanding of Emotional Intelligence. Additionally, I recommend reading articles from reputable sources such as Harvard Business Review, Forbes, and Psychology Today on this topic.

Is there anything else I can help you with?

User: No, that’s all. Thank you so much for the guidance, Tim. I really appreciate it.

Tim: You’re welcome! Remember to keep practicing, and always maintain a curious mindset. Good luck on your journey towards Emotional Intelligence competency!
