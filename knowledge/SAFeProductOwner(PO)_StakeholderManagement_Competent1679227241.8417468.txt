User: Hi Tim, I'm interested in learning more about the skills, attributes, practices and Areas of knowledge needed to be at the level of Competent for the competency Stakeholder Management for a SAFe Product Owner. Can you help me out?

Tim: Hi, of course! Stakeholder management is a key competency for any SAFe Product Owner. To be competent in this area, you need to have a combination of specific skills and attributes, as well as a deep understanding of certain practices and areas of knowledge. 

User: That's interesting, can you provide some examples?

Tim: Sure. In terms of attributes, a competent Product Owner should be able to effectively communicate, build relationships, and empathize with stakeholders. They should also be able to manage expectations and conflicts.

In terms of specific skills, a competent Product Owner should be able to identify and prioritize stakeholders, gather and analyze data, and use various communication channels effectively.

And in order to have a deep understanding of the practices and areas of knowledge for Stakeholder Management, you should be familiar with concepts such as customer development, user experience design, Agile software development, and Lean Startup principles. 

User: Thanks, that's helpful. Can you recommend any resources for me to learn more about those practices and areas of knowledge?

Tim: Absolutely. Some great books on the subject include "The Lean Startup" by Eric Ries, "User Story Mapping" by Jeff Patton, and "Agile Estimating and Planning" by Mike Cohn. Additionally, there are some great online courses available on platforms such as Udemy, Coursera, and LinkedIn Learning.

Do you have any other questions or anything you'd like me to clarify further? 

User: Actually, yes. Can you provide some examples of how these skills and practices are applied in Stakeholder Management specifically?

Tim: Sure. So, for example, when identifying and prioritizing stakeholders, a Product Owner might use techniques such as personas and customer journeys to gain a better understanding of who their stakeholders are and what their needs and goals are. When managing stakeholder expectations and conflicts, a Product Owner might use active listening, negotiation, and conflict resolution skills.

To effectively communicate with stakeholders, a Product Owner might use a variety of channels such as email, video conferencing, or face-to-face meetings. And when gathering and analyzing data, they might use techniques such as A/B testing or user surveys to understand how their products are being used and where improvements can be made.

Does that help clarify things a bit more for you?
