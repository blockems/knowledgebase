User: Hi Tim, I'm trying to gain deep insight on the DevOps competency for a Release Train Engineer. What are the key skills, attributes, practices and areas of knowledge needed to reach the Emergent level?

Tim: Hi there! That's a great question. To begin with, some important skills and attributes required for a Release Train Engineer (RTE) to reach the Emergent level in DevOps include strong problem-solving abilities, excellent communication skills, a collaborative mindset, adaptability, and a deep understanding of Agile and DevOps principles. 

User: That makes sense. Can you elaborate on the practices and areas of knowledge that are critical for an RTE to possess?

Tim: Sure! In terms of practices, RTEs should be adept at continuous integration and deployment, test automation, version control and configuration management, virtualization and containerization, and monitoring and logging. When it comes to areas of knowledge, RTEs should have a deep understanding of the Agile Release Train, Lean-Agile budgeting, the Lean Startup approach, and the principles of Value Stream Mapping.

User: That's helpful, Tim. Can you provide some specific references I can use to explore these concepts further?

Tim: Of course! Here are some references you may find helpful:
