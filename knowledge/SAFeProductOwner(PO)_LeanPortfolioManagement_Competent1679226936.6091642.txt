User: Hi Tim! Can you explain what the Lean Portfolio Management competency for a SAFe Product Owner (PO) entails? What skills, attributes, practices and areas of knowledge would I need to master in order to be considered competent in this field?

Tim: Sure, I'd be happy to help with that! The Lean Portfolio Management competency for a SAFe PO involves the ability to create and communicate a clear vision and strategy for the organization's product portfolio, as well as the skills to manage and coordinate the activities of all stakeholders involved in product development, including business owners, product managers, and technical teams.

To be considered competent in this area, you should have a strong understanding of Agile methodology, as well a deep knowledge of Lean principles and practices. Additionally, you will need advanced skills in strategic thinking, business acumen, and product management, as well as exceptional analytical and organizational skills. 

Finally, a competent SAFe PO will actively seek out and take advantage of opportunities to improve processes and outcomes across the organization. In short, this competency requires a highly skilled and knowledgeable individual with a passion for continuous improvement and driving results.

User: Interesting! Can you recommend any specific courses or resources for developing the skills needed for Lean Portfolio Management?

Some of the best options include courses and certifications offered by the Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe), such as the SAFe® PO/PM certification, as well as the Leading SAFe® course.
