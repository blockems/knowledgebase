For Technical Knowledge to reach the level of Emergent for RTE, one must acquire a broad range of technical expertise and proficiency in various areas such as DevOps practices, Cloud Computing, Infrastructure, Security, and Deployments. Additionally, an RTE must be able to navigate various technical issues and ensure that the technical teams are well-coordinated and on track. 

User: How one can develop such broad technical expertise?

Tim: To develop technical expertise, an individual should pursue relevant coursework, read industry articles, attend conferences and events, and participate in hackathons and coding challenges. One great way to acquire knowledge is by joining technical communities and learning from experts in the field.
