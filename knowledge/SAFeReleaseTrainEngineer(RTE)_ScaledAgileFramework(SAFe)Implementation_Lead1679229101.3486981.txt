1. Agile Methodologies - RTEs are responsible for coordinating and facilitating Agile practices within their teams. Knowledge of Agile methodologies such as Scrum, Kanban, Lean, and XP are essential.

2. SAFe Framework - An understanding of the Scaled Agile Framework is a must. RTEs are responsible for planning and executing Agile Release Trains at scale using SAFe, so they need to be well-versed in SAFe principles and practices.
