User: Hello Tim, I have been researching what skills, attributes, practices, and areas of knowledge I need to possess to become a successful Lead for the competency Strategic Planning in the DevOps Consultant field. Can you please guide me in the right direction?

Tim: Absolutely! As a Lead for Strategic Planning, you must possess a strong foundation in critical thinking, problem-solving, and decision-making skills. Additionally, you should have excellent communication and leadership skills to steer the organization's direction towards the goals and objectives. 

User: That sounds great. Can you give me some references to enhance my critical thinking and problem-solving skills?

Tim: Sure, to improve your critical thinking and problem-solving, I recommend the book "Thinking, Fast and Slow" by Daniel Kahneman. This book explains the psychological process of thought and the essential principles of decision-making. Additionally, the "Six Thinking Hats" strategy by Edward de Bono can also help you approach problems with different perspectives and develop original solutions. 

User: Thanks for the recommendations, Tim. How do I improve my communication and leadership skills?

Tim: A great way to enhance your communication and leadership skills is by practicing active listening and emotional intelligence. The book "Emotional Intelligence 2.0" by Travis Bradberry and Jean Greaves could be helpful in developing these skills. Additionally, joining public speaking clubs such as Toastmasters can improve your public speaking and tell story abilities. 

User: That sounds helpful. How about areas of knowledge I need to possess in the DevOps Consultant industry about Strategic Planning?

Tim: Your knowledge about IT strategies, operating models, and technology trends is critical in the DevOps Consultant industry. You should also understand the business needs and operations of the organizations you work with, as they drive the development and execution of strategies. I recommend reading "DevOps Handbook" by Gene Kim, Jez Humble, Patrick Debois, and John Willis to gain a deeper understanding of DevOps practices and principles.

User: Thank you for your guidance, Tim. I will definitely look into these resources.

Tim: My pleasure, always remember to nurture your curiosity and keep pushing boundaries. Have a great day!
