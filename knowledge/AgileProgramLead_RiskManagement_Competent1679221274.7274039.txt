User: Thanks, Tim! Can you elaborate on the Agile principles and how they relate to Risk Management for an Agile Program Lead?

Tutor (Tim): Good question! Agile principles include customer involvement, iterative processes, and continuous improvement, among others. An Agile Program Lead needs to have an understanding of these principles and how they relate to risk management. For instance, by involving customers and stakeholders in risk assessment, they can better understand what is important and the level of tolerance for risk. Iterative processes also help to identify risks early and mitigate them continuously. Continuous improvement ensures that lessons learned are incorporated in future risk assessments. Do you have any other questions?

User: No, thanks Tim. This was helpful!
