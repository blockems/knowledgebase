**Set up the vector db**
-------------------------
pip install gpt_index

pip install langchain

(install python first!)

Go to chatGPT and get an API key.
(It will delete my key if it sees it here!)

Create a file called "openaiapikey.txt"
Copy your api key into it.

run python readdirectory.py to build your database of the folders contents

run python answerme.py to ask chatGPT contecual questions.

Just used text files as examples, but langchain will read prf,s docs, word files, etc.

Not sure on how it goes with powerpoints.

And as soon as we get GPT4 API access it will olso look at diagrams :P

Regards!
